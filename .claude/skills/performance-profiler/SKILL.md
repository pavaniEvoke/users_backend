  Use this skill when the user reports something is slow, hangs, uses too
  much memory, or has degraded performance. Triggers on: "this is slow",
  "page is laggy", "query takes forever", "memory leak", "profile this",
  "performance regression", "how do I speed up X", "optimize this".

  Enforces measurement-first: don't suggest fixes until we know what's slow.

  Do NOT use for: writing fast code from scratch (code-quality concern), or
  general "is this efficient" questions about code that runs fine.

# Performance Profiler

Performance fixes without measurement are guesses. You measure first, hypothesize, fix, verify. You refuse to suggest optimizations without data.

## The framework: Measure, Hypothesize, Fix, Verify

### Step 1: Measure (always first)

When the user says something is slow, before suggesting anything, ask:
- **What's slow?** Be specific — page X, endpoint Y, function Z, query Q
- **How slow?** Specific number — "3 seconds" not "feels slow"
- **Compared to what?** Baseline (production, last week, similar feature)
- **Reproducibility?** Always slow, or only sometimes?
- **At what scale?** 10 rows or 10M? Single user or 1000 concurrent?

If they don't have measurements, give them the right tool to measure:

| Symptom | Measurement tool |
|---------|------------------|
| Frontend perception (slow page) | Chrome DevTools Performance tab + Lighthouse |
| API endpoint latency | Browser Network tab, curl + `time`, server logs |
| Database query | EXPLAIN ANALYZE (Postgres), EXPLAIN (MySQL), `.explain('executionStats')` (MongoDB) |
| Backend function | Profilers: Node `--prof`, Python `cProfile`, Java JFR |
| Memory leak | Chrome DevTools Memory tab, heap snapshots |
| React rerenders | React DevTools Profiler |
| Bundle size | `next build` output, webpack-bundle-analyzer |
| Network waterfall | Browser Network tab, `curl -w` for breakdown |

DON'T suggest a fix before measurement exists.

### Step 2: Hypothesize from data

Once measurement data is available, look for the actual bottleneck:

#### Read the data carefully

For a slow query, EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows:
- Sequential scans on big tables (missing index? wrong index?)
- Nested loops with high row counts (bad join order?)
- Sort operations exceeding work_mem
- High planning time (parameter sniffing? prepared statements issue?)

For a slow API call:
- Time to first byte (server-side processing) vs body transfer (network)
- Total time vs sum of subcalls (concurrent vs sequential opportunity)

For slow page load:
- LCP (largest contentful paint) — blocked by render-blocking resources?
- TTI (time to interactive) — main thread blocked by JS?
- CLS (cumulative layout shift) — fonts/images shifting layout?

For memory growth:
- Detached DOM nodes (event listeners holding refs)
- Closures retaining unexpected scope
- Unbounded caches / arrays / maps

#### Distinguish symptoms from causes

A slow page may have many symptoms:
- High LCP — probably a slow API or large image
- High TTI — too much JS to parse/execute
- High CLS — layout shifts from missing dimensions

Pick ONE bottleneck — the biggest contributor — and fix it before moving on.

### Step 3: Fix (the right thing)

Match the fix to the diagnosed cause. Common patterns:

#### Database

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sequential scan on large table | Add index on filter column(s) |
| Index exists but not used | Check stats: `ANALYZE table`. Rewrite query. |
| Multiple queries that could be one | JOIN or batched query |
| N+1 queries | Eager loading (`include` / `with` / `JOIN`) |
| Slow aggregation | Materialized view or summary table |
| Slow ORDER BY | Index supporting the sort |

#### API endpoint

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Long server-side processing | Profile to find the hot function |
| Multiple sequential API calls | `Promise.all`, batched endpoint |
| Large response body | Pagination, field selection, compression |
| Slow third-party API | Cache responses, parallel calls, timeout + fallback |
| Cold start | Keep-warm pings, smaller bundle, faster runtime |

#### Frontend

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Large bundle | Code split, tree shake, dynamic imports |
| Slow render | React.memo, useMemo for expensive computations |
| Janky scroll | Virtualization (react-window), throttle scroll handlers |
| Layout shift | Set explicit width/height on images, use font-display |
| Re-render storm | Profile with React DevTools, find the cause |

#### Memory

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Detached DOM | Remove event listeners on unmount |
| Closure retention | Restructure to release references |
| Unbounded cache | LRU with max size, TTL eviction |
| Heap growing | Heap snapshots at intervals, find the growing type |

### Step 4: Verify

After applying the fix, RE-MEASURE. Don't trust intuition that it's faster.

Same tool, same workload, same conditions. The number must move:
- Query: from 800ms to 12ms (with EXPLAIN ANALYZE confirming index use)
- Page load: LCP from 4.2s to 1.1s
- Memory: heap stable at 50MB instead of growing 5MB/min

If it didn't help, the hypothesis was wrong. Go back to step 2.

If it helped a little but not enough, repeat the process for the next
biggest bottleneck.

## Common anti-patterns to call out

### "Just add an index"

Indexes have costs (write performance, storage, lock during creation).
Adding the wrong index doesn't help and adds debt. Only add the index that
EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows would be used.

### "Use a faster framework"

The framework is rarely the bottleneck. Profile to find the real cost.

### "Add caching"

Caching adds correctness risk (stale data, invalidation bugs). Use it only
when:
- The underlying operation is genuinely expensive
- The data tolerates being slightly stale
- Cache hit rate will be high enough to matter
- Invalidation strategy is clear

### "Make it async"

Async doesn't make slow things fast — it just unblocks the caller. If the
slow thing must complete before the user sees a result, async doesn't help
the user.

### "Optimize the hot loop"

Often the hot loop is fine; the work it's calling INTO is slow. Profile
inside the loop.

### "Rewrite in [faster language]"

Almost always premature. If Python/JS/Ruby is too slow, the bottleneck is
usually I/O (which the language doesn't fix) or algorithmic (which a faster
language won't fix).

## Special domains

### React performance

Common real causes (in order of frequency):
1. Re-renders triggered by parent (use React DevTools Profiler)
2. Unmemoized callbacks/objects passed to memoized children
3. Expensive computations in render (move to useMemo)
4. Too many DOM nodes (virtualize)
5. Synchronous state updates triggering layout thrash

Don't suggest `React.memo` on every component. It can make things SLOWER if
props change frequently.

### Backend Node.js

Common real causes:
1. Event loop blocked by sync work (especially crypto, JSON.parse on huge payloads)
2. Database round-trips (N+1, sequential when parallel was possible)
3. Memory pressure causing GC pauses
4. Unbounded data in memory (entire result set loaded vs streamed)

Use `clinic.js` or Node's built-in `--prof`.

### Postgres

Don't reach for `pg_stat_statements` if you can EXPLAIN ANALYZE the specific
slow query. EXPLAIN tells you the plan; ANALYZE tells you reality.

Common patterns:
- "Seq Scan on big_table (rows=1000000)" → index needed
- "Hash Join" with high row count → fine usually, the right algorithm
- "Sort: external merge" → exceeded work_mem; either bigger work_mem or
  index supporting the sort
- High planning time → consider preparing the query, or generic plans

### MongoDB

`.explain('executionStats')` shows:
- `totalDocsExamined` vs `nReturned` — high ratio = bad index match
- `executionTimeMillis` — actual time
- Stage breakdown — IXSCAN good, COLLSCAN bad

## What you don't do

- **Don't suggest fixes before measurements.** It's malpractice.
- **Don't run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on production unmonitored.** It actually
  executes the query.
- **Don't suggest premature parallelization.** A sequential 50ms call ≠
  worth parallelizing.
- **Don't claim a fix without re-measuring.** The user trusts you to know
  if it actually worked.
