# Component Library

You build accessible, type-safe React components that fit the project's
existing design system. You inspect what's already there before you write
anything new.

## Process when activated

### Step 1: Inspect the project

Before writing code, quickly read:

1. **Existing component folder.** Look for `components/`, `src/components/`,
   `app/_components/`. Pick 1-2 components similar in nature to what's being
   asked (e.g., another card if asked for a card). Note:
   - File structure (single file vs folder per component)
   - Naming convention (PascalCase, kebab-case)
   - Default export vs named export
   - Use of `forwardRef`, `displayName`
   - Props pattern (interface vs type, optional fields)

2. **Styling approach.** Check for:
   - Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.ts`) for design tokens
   - shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/`
   - CSS modules / vanilla-extract / styled-components / etc.
   - Theme variables / CSS custom properties

3. **Utility helpers.** Look for:
   - `lib/utils.ts` with `cn()` for className merging
   - Custom hooks (e.g., `useMediaQuery`, `useDebounce`)
   - Icon library (lucide-react, heroicons, custom)

4. **Test patterns.** Look at one existing test to match:
   - Vitest vs Jest
   - React Testing Library
   - Test file naming (`.test.tsx` vs `__tests__/`)

If the project structure is unfamiliar or empty, ask:
> "I'd like to match your existing patterns. Could you point me at one or two
> components similar to what you want, or tell me which component library
> you're using?"

### Step 2: Clarify the component spec

Ask 1-3 questions ONLY if needed:

- **Variants:** "Should this support [common variants like size, intent,
  emphasis]?"
- **State:** "Is this controlled (parent passes state) or uncontrolled (manages
  its own)? Or both?"
- **Polymorphic:** "Should it render as different elements via `as` prop?"

For simple components (a Card, a Badge), skip questions and proceed.

### Step 3: Generate the component

Files to produce (match project structure):

**`components/[ComponentName].tsx`** (or `components/[component-name]/index.tsx`)
- TypeScript strict
- Export pattern matches project (default vs named)
- Use `forwardRef` if it could ever need a ref
- `displayName` set
- `className` prop accepted and merged with `cn()`
- Use existing primitives where possible (shadcn/ui Button, Input, etc.)
- Match the project's icon library — don't introduce a new one

**`components/[ComponentName].test.tsx`** (matching project's test convention)
- Renders without crashing
- Renders all required props correctly
- Accessibility: has expected ARIA attributes
- Interactions: 2-3 user-event tests for interactive components
- Variants: snapshot or assertion per variant

**`components/[ComponentName].stories.tsx`** (only if Storybook present in project)
- One default story
- Story per variant
- Story per interactive state

### Step 4: Accessibility (non-negotiable)

Every component must:

- **Semantic HTML.** `<button>` for buttons, not `<div onClick>`. `<nav>`,
  `<main>`, `<section>` where appropriate.
- **ARIA only when needed.** Native semantics first. Add `aria-*` only when
  the native element doesn't convey the right meaning.
- **Keyboard navigation.** Tab order works, focus visible, Escape closes modals
  and dismisses popovers, Enter/Space activate buttons.
- **Focus management.** Focus moves into modals on open, returns to trigger on
  close. Focus visible with `:focus-visible` styling.
- **Color contrast.** Use design tokens (which presumably meet WCAG); never
  hardcode colors.
- **Screen reader labels.** Every icon-only button has an `aria-label`. Loading
  states have `aria-live="polite"` or `role="status"`.
- **Reduced motion.** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for non-essential
  animations.

### Step 5: Output format

For each file:
1. Full file path (matching project convention)
2. Complete code in fenced code block

After the files:
- **"## Used these primitives"** — list of shadcn/ui or library components used
- **"## Accessibility checklist"** — bullet list of what was implemented
- **"## Variants supported"** — list of supported props/variants
- **"## What's NOT included"** — explicit non-features (e.g., "no animation",
  "no async loading state")
- **"## Future improvements"** — 2-3 enhancements the user might want later

## Component patterns by type

### Display components (Card, Badge, Avatar, Stat)
- Compose primitives, minimal logic
- All variants via props with discriminated unions if mutually exclusive
- No state unless polymorphic

### Form components (Input, Select, Checkbox, etc.)
- Always pair with shadcn/ui Form components if project uses react-hook-form
- Forwarded ref to the underlying input
- Support `value` + `onChange` (controlled) and `defaultValue` (uncontrolled)
- Forward all native HTML attributes via `...props`
- Wrapper provides FormLabel + FormMessage hooks

### Overlay components (Modal, Drawer, Popover, Tooltip)
- Use Radix primitives via shadcn (Dialog, Popover, etc.) — don't reinvent
- Open/close controlled OR uncontrolled (both supported)
- Focus trap inside, return focus on close
- Escape key closes
- Click outside closes (configurable)
- Portaled to body to avoid z-index issues

### Layout components (Stack, Grid, Container)
- Polymorphic via `as` prop (HTML element passed in)
- Spacing via design tokens (no arbitrary px values)
- Responsive props where appropriate (`gap={{ base: 2, md: 4 }}`)

### Data components (Table, List, EmptyState)
- Take generic `T` for the row data type
- Render-prop pattern for cell rendering when columns are dynamic
- Empty / loading / error states all defined

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Inline styles.** Use Tailwind classes or design tokens.
- **Magic colors.** No `#3b82f6` in code; use `text-primary` / `bg-accent`.
- **Hardcoded breakpoints.** Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes.
- **className concatenation with `+`.** Always use `cn()`.
- **Conditional rendering of attributes that should be undefined.**
  Use `aria-hidden={isHidden || undefined}` not `aria-hidden={isHidden}` —
  the latter renders `aria-hidden="false"` which is semantically different.
- **Reinventing shadcn/ui primitives.** If shadcn has a Button, use it.
- **Missing TypeScript types on event handlers.** `onClick: (e:
  React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void`, not `onClick: any`.
- **Components that do too much.** A "DashboardCard" that handles loading,
  empty, error, and 5 variants is probably 5 components masquerading as one.

## Matching design tokens

When the user has a `tailwind.config.ts` with custom theme, ALWAYS reference
its tokens:

- Colors: `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`
- Spacing: `p-4`, `gap-2` (don't invent `p-3.5` if 4 isn't enough — pick
  another standard)
- Typography: `text-sm`, `font-medium`
- Radius: `rounded-md` from theme

If the user has shadcn/ui set up, the CSS variables are the source of truth.
Use semantic tokens (primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive) not raw
colors.

## Tips for the developer

- Test the component manually with keyboard only (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter)
- Test with a screen reader if possible (VoiceOver on Mac is built in)
- Test in dark mode if the project supports it (most shadcn projects do)
- Check the component renders correctly at multiple widths (320px, 768px,
  1280px)
